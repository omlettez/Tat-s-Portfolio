                            This is the NSC Project that I made it up with my friend in Figma. It's an app for learning about basic of arts. It will teach you all about
                            basic like lines, color, shapes, etc. This app also has a quiz feature that allow you to test yourself. Also you can create your own artwork
                            in this application. But this application didn't qualify for the competition.

                            This application's "Bok Rod", It's the part of a class that I studied and they want us to make an business app. It's an application to 
                            find a driver that will share their car seats for everybody that want a ride but don't wanna spend too much for it. 
                            This will make you meet someone new and maybe you'll get a new friends! You can also be a driver if you have a car but you'll need to verify yourself first.
                            But due to the covid-19 I think this app won't gonna be good.
